# samsung_tidy_data
The R script, run_analysis.R, downloads the accelerometer and gyroscope smartphone data collected by Samsung and tidies the data. The resulting dataset contains 30 rows representing 30 subjects and 25 columns represent variables explained in the codebook below. 


Codebook:
1. Subject - subject identification number
2. Walking_mean_acceleration - average of all mean accelerometer measurments for walking activity
3. Walking_sd_acceleration - average of all std accelerometer measurments for walking activity
4. Walking_mean_velocity - average of all mean gyroscope measurments for walking activity
5. Walking_sd_velocity - average of all std gyroscope measurments for walking activity
6. Walking.Upstairs_mean_acceleration - average of all mean accelerometer measurments for walking upstairs activity
Walking.Upstairs_sd_acceleration - average of all std accelerometer measurments for walking upstairs activity
Walking.Upstairs_mean_velocity - average of all mean gyroscope measurments for walking upstairs activity
Walking.Upstairs_sd_velocity - average of all std gyroscope measurments for walking upstairs activity
